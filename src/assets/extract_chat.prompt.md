**Requirements:**
1. **Literal Data**: Capture exact raw content, not summaries
2. **Complete Command History**: Every command suggested/executed with full output
3. **File Change Tracking**: Every file modification with actual code snippets
4. **Chronological Order**: All interactions in sequence order
5. **No Data Loss**: Include everything, even failed attempts or corrections
6. **Consistent Schema**: Use this exact structure regardless of AI model
7. **Raw Terminal Output**: Include complete command outputs, error messages, etc.
8. **Code Snippets**: Include actual code blocks that were created/modified

**Instructions:**
- Create the `.github/chat_history/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Generate the JSON file with the specified naming convention
- Ensure all arrays are properly formatted even if empty
- Include this prompt itself as the final step in raw_chat_interactions
- Validate JSON syntax before outputting
- If any data is too large, create separate reference files but note them in the main JSON
